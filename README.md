# bullpy

bullpy aims to be the first open source library to compute the basis between bonds and CDS. 

The ambition is to also calculate some additional analytics that are missing from the existing open source libraries.

By the end of 2024 I hope to achieve the following:
* (WIP) Payment schedule (date adjustements, calendars, day count coneventions, payment frequency, roll conventions, schedules etc.)
* Interpolation schemes and Root finders
* Discount curve and credit curve providers
* Bond pricer
* CDS pricer
* Bond-CDS basis!
